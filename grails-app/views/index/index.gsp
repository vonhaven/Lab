            This Alchemy lab site is an experimental Alpha-phase project.
            The intent of this site is to provide an entertaining, immersive, and randomly-generated
                ecosystem in which the player must discover reagents and deduce "factual" information
                about their states.
            The only way a player may learn and remember the supernatural properties of reagents
                (whose effects are randomly generated at player creation, so each player has a unique
                and unspoofable experience) is by discovering them through mixing.
            Each reagent may have up to four properties, and two to four different types of reagents
                may be mixed into a single solution.
            Only one pair of magical properties across reagents is required to add that particular
                property to a solution.
            Therefore, a solution may have any combination of one to eight various effects.
            Effects may be helpful, harmful, or neutral in nature.
            Therefore, the most valuable potions are those which are highly refined and contain
                the least number of conflicting effects.
            A potion with three helpful effects and one neutral effect, for example, is much more
                valuable than one with two helpful effects and two harmful effects.
            At the same time, a purely toxic potion (say, five harmful effects) is much more
                valuable than a potion with a combination of helpful, harmful, and neutral effects.
